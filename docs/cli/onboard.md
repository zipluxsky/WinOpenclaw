## Examples

```bash
openclaw onboard
openclaw onboard --flow quickstart
openclaw onboard --flow manual
openclaw onboard --mode remote --remote-url ws://gateway-host:18789
```

Flow notes:

- `quickstart`: minimal prompts, auto-generates a gateway token.
- `manual`: full prompts for port/bind/auth (alias of `advanced`).
- Fastest first chat: `openclaw dashboard` (Control UI, no channel setup).
- Custom Provider: connect any OpenAI or Anthropic compatible endpoint,
  including hosted providers not listed. Use Unknown to auto-detect.

## Common follow-up commands

```bash
openclaw configure
openclaw agents add <name>
```

<Note>
`--json` does not imply non-interactive mode. Use `--non-interactive` for scripts.
